## How to view

This code is scaffolded with Yeoman and requires that [node.js ](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) be installed. Please install these first. Additionally, this project depends on a separate project provided by Udacity to create an API end-point. This project is available on [git ](https://github.com/udacity/mws-restaurant-stage-3). Please follow the instructions there.

Once you have these dependencies installed and the API server is started, do the following:

1. In the terminal, navigate to this project folder.

2. run `npm install` to install project dependencies.

3. run `gulp serve`.

4. With your server running, visit the site: `http://localhost:9000` and explore some restaurants.

5. In Chrome you can open the Console, go to Application / Service Workers, and then check the Offline option to see offline behavior.
